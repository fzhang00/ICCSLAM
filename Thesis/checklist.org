** TODO chapter6 simfig38-39, merge into one figure showing only the related. (feature mapping error vs feature ground truth position) [[file:chapter6.tex::TODO%20simfig38-39:Merge%20these%20two%20into%20one,%20shoing%20only%20the%20related.][link]]
** Camera intrinsic parameter simulation
*** $(c_x, c_y)$ simulation
**** TODO Find out why features with Z position >200m are filtered for all c_x settings
**** TODO Similar stuff happens with c_y settings. 
*** $(f_x, f_y)$ simulation
**** TODO Find out why features with Z position higher than 100m are filter for higher f_x f_y settings
*** Lens distortion simulation
**** DONE Distortion analysis needs UAS localization error
**** DONE plot distortion error vs feature ground truth position.
**** TODO Find relationship for feature X position error in distortion simulation
**** TODO Find out why feature with Z position beyond 200m are filtered 
** TODO figure49 in SimulationFigures folder doesn't have title
** TODO All figure title and label size needs to be adjust
** TODO figure size in article needs to be adjust for better layout.
