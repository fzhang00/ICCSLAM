* figure 5.3 [66%]
*** DONE First letter of the title should be capital
*** DONE Change "removed" to "subtracted"
*** TODO Verify correlation of \varphi with Z rotation and \theta with X rotation
* DONE 4.3.2 Data Prep
*** DONE SUAS localization should be compared in WORLD frame
To keep landmark and SUAS result in the same reference frame and
avoid confusion
- [X] Text needs update
- [X] True SUAS position and orientation formula needs update

* DONE Figure 5.4 - change reference frame to world
*** DONE update get_GroundTruth_UAS_Motion in process_motion_sim.py
- [X] add variable gtUASMotion_world to contain SUAS position and
  orientation reference to world frame

*** DONE change SUAS localization error plot in Flight Result-cut1 notebook
- [X] Call variable in world frame instead of UTM for comparison.

* DONE Add xlabel to UAV poses plot.
- Code done but not yet compile.

* Merge figure 5.15 and 5.16 and make it the same format as previous [100%]
** DONE Found source data file
*** DONE found source data file
*** DONE is it workable by the process_sim...py file?
*** DONE if not, output result from .mat file
** DONE start another workbook and plot figure
*** DONE import data file/result
*** DONE use the same script to plot these figure. 

** DONE Change figure 5.16 similar to previous format
* DONE change figure 6.12 title.
* DONE change figure 6.15 title.
* TODO figure 6.16 
** DONE title and legend position.
** TODO find out why some features were missing for largest f_x/y offset.
   - bigger scaling factor caused features out of the FOV of the
     camera, so landmarks with big y_groundtruth were removed during
     tracking. But what about the big negative y_groundtruth?
   - disable feature filtering showed that the missing landmarks were
     those with tracking frames less than 5. Try re-run the
     simulation with no noise on all 5 D.O.F. Result is the same
   - The feature deletion in CC_EKF_SLAM is set to 50 pixel in from
     right edge because of the black ban on the right edge of the
     image. This might be why. 
     

** DONE make the figure larger
* DONE regenerate figure 6.18 to make X axis more readable. change UAS to UAV
* DONE Erase title on figure 6.20
as well as set tick for xyz to make x ticks more readable.
* DONE Erase title on figure 6.19, relocate x-axis label. 
* DONE % regenerate to make room for x axis label. change feature to landmark
* TODO Add average landmark error for 1st video and 2nd video. Correct average error number in conclusion for 2nd video
* TODO findout why some landmark with position on Z bigger than 200m were deleted for all cx,cy setting
