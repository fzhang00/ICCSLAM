\section{Equipment Setup and Flight Data Collection}
% word checked.
The biggest contribution of the project is that the proposed algorithm
was tested and proved feasible with real flight data collected by the
author. The aerial video and navigation data were collected through a
survey flight with the support of Sander Geophysics Ltd. A main
purpose of the test flight was to obtain aerial video with the camera
close to the ground to mimic the scenario of a low flying UAV. This is
difficult to achieve with any manned fixed wing aircraft since terrain
following flight at low altitude is very dangerous. Therefore, a
helicopter was used to conduct the survey flight to achieve the
terrain following action. To get sensors close to the ground and to
allow for flexible sensor mounting, a simulated unmanned aircraft
system (SUAS) was used to carry all sensors. The SUAS was towed by a
helicopter via a tow rope of 33 meters length (Figure
\ref{fig:towedSUAS}). Yet, sufficient clearance must be established
between the SUAS and the vegetation to prevent the SUAS from being
caught by tree branches. As a result, the helicopter flew a planned
path at approximately 100 meters above ground, and the SUAS was at
approximately 70 meters above ground.

Sensors mounted on the SUAS (Figure \ref{fig:SUAS}) included one wide
angle CCD camera with 480x720 resolution and 6mm focal length lens
capturing monocular image sequence at 30 frames per second, a pair of
narrow angle CCD cameras for binocular image sequences, a GPS antenna,
a three-axes fluxgate sensor, and Athena GS-111m. The Athena GS-111m
is a flight control INS/GPS navigation unit \cite{_athena_????} that
captures, estimates and outputs 16 channels of data, such as velocity,
acceleration, rotation, altitude, GPS coordinates, at a sample rate of
up to 100Hz per channel. Analog video and navigation data were sent to
the helicopter via three BNC cables and one data cable for recording.
Installed in the helicopter were two SGL data acquisition systems,
named CDAC (Figure \ref{fig:CDAC}). The CDAC on top recorded video
from the monocular camera, navigation data from the Athena GS-111m, as
well as data from sensors installed on the helicopter, including GPS,
radar altimeter, laser altimeter, air pressure, temperature, humidity,
etc. The CDAC at the bottom recorded video from the binocular cameras.
Videos from the three cameras were digitized using three Parvus MPEG4
video encoders installed in the CDACs, and time-stamped with GPS
second on the image screen (Figure \ref{fig:video_snapshot}) for
post-flight synchronization with the navigation data. Because the test
flight recorded data from all available sensors on board the SUAS and
the helicopter, these recordings would still be useful should any
future research require more sensor data.

\section{Camera Calibration}\label{sec:camcal}
% word checked
Camera calibration decodes the relation between image pixels and the
actual 3D world. The intrinsic parameters could be affected by a
number of environmental conditions, such as temperature, and humidity.
To extract the camera parameters at a camera condition as close as
possible to the one during test flight, camera calibration was
performed right after the SUAS returned to the SGL hanger. The camera
calibration was done by taking a video of a checkerboard pattern with
various translations and orientations from the camera. A total of 20 views
of the calibration target were chosen from the video, and fed to the
calibration algorithm. A few examples are shown in Figure
\ref{fig:camcal}.

The program ``calibration.exe'' was used to calibrate the camera. This
program came with the OpenCV installation. The digitized images have a
resolution of 720 pixels in width and 480 pixels in height. Table
\ref{tab:camcalresult} below lists the calibration results.

\section{Ground Truth Data Collection}
The localization ground truth was obtained through the flight
control unit GS-111m on board the SUAS. The unit recorded the SUAS
position in GPS longitude and latitude coordinates. Orientation was
obtained from the roll pitch and heading measurements. Roll and pitch
accuracy has $0.1^\circ$ and $0.1^\circ$ standard deviation.
Heading accuracy can achieve $0.5^\circ$ \cite{_athena_????}.

Landmark position ground truth came from a digital elevation map (DEM)
downloaded from the CGIAR-CSI website \cite{_cgiar-csi_????}. The DEM
contains longitude, latitude and sea level elevation of the terrain
with a resolution of approximately 90 meters by 90 meters. The
reported vertical error of the DEM is less than 16 meters.
