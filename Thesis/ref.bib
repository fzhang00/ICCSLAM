	abstract = {Airborne time domain electromagnetic ({TDEM)} surveys are increasingly carried out in anthropized areas as part of environmental studies. In such areas, noise arises mainly from either natural sources, such as spherics, or cultural sources, such as couplings with man-made installations. This results in various distortions on the measured decays, which make the {EM} noise spectrum complex and may lead to erroneous inversion and subsequent misinterpretations. Thresholding and stacking standard techniques, commonly used to filter {TDEM} data, are less efficient in such environment, requiring a time-consuming and subjective manual editing. The aim of this study was therefore to propose an alternative fast and efficient user-assisted filtering approach. This was achieved using the singular value decomposition ({SVD).} The {SVD} method uses the principal component analysis to extract into components the dominant shapes from a series of raw input curves. {EM} decays can then be reconstructed with particular components only. To do so, we had to adapt and implement the {SVD}, firstly, to separate clearly and so identify easily the components containing the geological signal, and then to denoise properly {TDEM} data. The reconstructed decays were used to detect noisy gates on their corresponding measured decays. This denoising step allowed rejecting efficiently mainly spikes and oscillations. Then, we focused on couplings with man-made installations, which may result in artifacts on the inverted models. An analysis of the map of weights of the selected “noisy components” highlighted high correlations with man-made installations localized by the flight video. We had therefore a tool to cull most likely decays biased by capacitive coupling noises. Finally, rejection of decays affected by galvanic coupling noises was also possible locating them through the analysis of specific {SVD} components. This {SVD} procedure was applied on airborne {TDEM} data surveyed by {SkyTEM} Aps. over an anthropized area, on behalf of the French geological survey ({BRGM)}, near Courtenay in Région Centre, France. The established denoising procedure provides accurate denoising tools and makes, at least, the manual cleaning less time consuming and less subjective.},

	abstract = {Simultaneous localization and mapping ({SLAM)} algorithms based on local maps have been demonstrated to be well suited for mapping large environments as they reduce the computational cost and improve the consistency of the final estimation. The main contribution of this paper is a novel submapping technique that does not require independence between maps. The technique is based on the intrinsic structure of the {SLAM} problem that allows the building of submaps that can share information, remaining conditionally independent. The resulting algorithm obtains local maps in constant time during the exploration of new terrain and recovers the global map in linear time after simple loop closures without introducing any approximations besides the inherent extended Kalman filter linearizations. The memory requirements are also linear with the size of the map. As the algorithm works in a covariance form, well-known data-association techniques can be used in the usual manner. We present experimental results using a handheld monocular camera, building a map along a closed-loop trajectory of 140 m in a public square, with people and other clutter. Our results show that the combination of conditional independence, which enables the system to share the camera and feature states between submaps, and local coordinates, which reduce the effects of linearization errors, allow us to obtain precise maps of large areas with pure monocular {SLAM} in real time.},

As a result, the covariance estimates of the {EKF} undergo reduction in directions of the state space where no information is available, which is a primary cause of inconsistency. To address this issue, a new "first estimates Jacobian" ({FEJ)} {EKF} is proposed, which is shown to perform better in terms of consistency. In the {FEJ-} {EKF}, the filter Jacobians are calculated using the first-ever available estimates for each state variable, which insures that the observable subspace of the error-state system model is of the same dimension as that of the underlying nonlinear {SLAM} system.

Building an incremental map while also using it for localisation is of prime importance for mobile robot navigation but, until recently, has been confined to small-scale, mostly indoor, environments. The critical problems for large-scale implementations are as follows. First, data association--- finding correspondences between map landmarks and robot sensor measurements---becomes difficult in complex, cluttered environments, especially if the robot location is uncertain. Second, the information required to maintain a consistent map using traditional methods imposes a prohibitive computational burden as the map increases in size. And third, the mathematics for {SLAM} relies on assumptions of small errors and near-linearity, and these become invalid for larger maps.},

	abstract = {We present a new parametrization for point features within monocular simultaneous localization and mapping ({SLAM)} that permits efficient and accurate representation of uncertainty during undelayed initialization and beyond, all within the standard extended Kalman filter ({EKF).} The key concept is direct parametrization of the inverse depth of features relative to the camera locations from which they were first viewed, which produces measurement equations with a high degree of linearity. Importantly, our parametrization can cope with features over a huge range of depths, even those that are so far from the camera that they present little parallax during motion—maintaining sufficient representative uncertainty that these points retain the opportunity to "come in” smoothly from infinity if the camera makes larger movements. Feature initialization is undelayed in the sense that even distant features are immediately used to improve camera motion estimates, acting initially as bearing references but not permanently labeled as such. The inverse depth parametrization remains well behaved for features at all stages of {SLAM} processing, but has the drawback in computational terms that each point is represented by a 6-D state vector as opposed to the standard three of a Euclidean {XYZ} representation. We show that once the depth estimate of a feature is sufficiently accurate, its representation can safely be converted to the Euclidean {XYZ} form, and propose a linearity index that allows automatic detection and conversion to maintain maximum efficiency—only low parallax features need be maintained in inverse depth form for long periods. We present a real-time implementation at 30 Hz, where the parametrization is validated in a fully automatic 3-D {SLAM} system featuring a handheld single camera with no additional sensing. Experiments show robust operation in challenging indoor and outdoor environments with a very large ranges of scene depth, varied motion, and als- - o real time 360deg loop closing.},

	abstract = {The simultaneous localization and map building ({SLAM)} problem asks if it is possible for an autonomous vehicle to start in an unknown location in an unknown environment and then to incrementally build a map of this environment while simultaneously using this map to compute absolute vehicle location. Starting from estimation-theoretic foundations of this problem, the paper proves that a solution to the {SLAM} problem is indeed possible. The underlying structure of the {SLAM} problem is first elucidated. A proof that the estimated map converges monotonically to a relative map with zero uncertainty is then developed. It is then shown that the absolute accuracy of the map and the vehicle location reach a lower bound defined only by the initial vehicle uncertainty. Together, these results show that it is possible for an autonomous vehicle to start in an unknown location in an unknown environment and, using relative observations only, incrementally build a perfect map of the world and to compute simultaneously a bounded estimate of vehicle location. The paper also describes a substantial implementation of the {SLAM} algorithm on a vehicle operating in an outdoor environment using millimeter-wave radar to provide relative map observations. This implementation is used to demonstrate how some key issues such as map management and data association can be handled in a practical environment. The results obtained are cross-compared with absolute locations of the map landmarks obtained by surveying. In conclusion, the paper discusses a number of key issues raised by the solution to the {SLAM} problem including suboptimal map-building algorithms and map management},

The representation is a graph of coordinate frames, with each vertex in the graph representing a local frame and each edge representing the transformation between adjacent frames. In each frame, we build a map that captures the local environment and the current robot pose along with the uncertainties of each. Each map’s uncertainties are modeled with respect to its own frame. Probabilities of entities with respect to arbitrary frames are generated by following a path formed by the edges between adjacent frames, computed using either Dijkstra’s shortest path algorithm or breath-first search. Loop closing is achieved via an efficient map matching algorithm coupled with a cycle verification step. We demonstrate the performance of the technique for post-processing large data sets, including an indoor structured environment (2.2 km path length) with multiple nested loops using laser or ultrasonic ranging sensors. 1},

	abstract = {This thesis examines the problem of localising an Autonomous Guided Vehicle ({AGV)} travelling in an unknown environment. In this problem, the {AGV} faces the dual task of modeling the environment and simultaneously localising its position within it. The Simultaneous Localisation and Map Building ({SLAM)} problem is currently one of the most important goals of {AGV} research. Solving this problem would allow {anAGV} to be deployed easily, with very little initial preparation. The {AGV} would also be exible and able to cope with modi cations in the environment. A solution to the {SLAM} problem would enable an {AGV} to would be truly {\textbackslash}autonomous." The thesis examines the {SLAM} problem from an estimation theoretic point ofview. The estimation approach provides a rigorous framework for the analysis and has also proven to be successful in actual applications. The most signi cant contribution of this thesis is to provide, for the rst time, a detailed development of the theory of the {SLAM} problem. It is shown that correlations arise between errors in the vehicle and the map estimates, and these correlations are identi ed as fundamentally important to the solution of the {SLAM} problem. It is demonstrated that ignoring these correlations results in the loss of the fundamental structure of the {SLAM} problem and leads to inconsistency in map},

	abstract = {This paper first demonstrates an interesting property of bundle adjustment ({BA)}, “scale drift correction”. Here “scale drift correction” means that {BA} can converge to the correct solution (up to a scale) even if the initial values of the camera pose translations and point feature positions are calculated using very different scale factors. This property together with other properties of {BA} makes it the best approach for monocular Simultaneous Localization and Mapping ({SLAM)}, without considering the computational complexity. This naturally leads to the idea of using local {BA} and map joining to solve large-scale monocular {SLAM} problem, which is proposed in this paper. The local maps are built through Scale-Invariant Feature Transform ({SIFT)} for feature detection and matching, random sample consensus ({RANSAC)} paradigm at different levels for robust outlier removal, and {BA} for optimization. To reduce the computational cost of the large-scale map building, the features in each local map are judiciously selected and then the local maps are combined using a recently developed {3D} map joining algorithm. The proposed large-scale monocular {SLAM} algorithm is evaluated using a publicly available dataset with centimeter-level ground truth.},

The first part highlights the structure of uncertainty of an estimated map with the key result being {“Certainty} of Relations despite Uncertainty of Positions”. A formal proof for approximate sparsity of so-called information matrices occurring in {SLAM} is sketched. It supports the above mentioned characterization and provides a foundation for algorithms based on sparse information matrices. Further, issues of nonlinearity and the duality between information and covariance matrices are discussed and related to common methods for solving {SLAM.} Finally, three requirements concerning map quality, storage space and computation time an ideal {SLAM} solution should have are proposed. The current state of the art is discussed with respect to these requirements including a formal specification of the term “map quality”.},

	abstract = {This paper describes a stereoscopic imaging algorithm that is modified for obstacle detection in low flying unmanned aerial vehicles ({UAVs).} In this type of flight, obstacle detection must be carried out quickly for the system to be effective in real time. Additionally, since the aircraft is close to the ground, the horizon is usually at the top of the field of view and obstacles must be distinguished from the clutter of the terrain. The sparse edge detection and reconstruction algorithm proposed, produces fast but partial reconstructions of the environment. One image is passed through a series of edge detectors to generate a very sparse outline of the environment. This outline is then correlated to the second image and the resulting reconstruction is added to a model of the environment. Although each individual reconstruction is incomplete, the overall result after a short initialization period is a model of the environment that is more comprehensive than a single stereoscopic correlation run with a more detailed edge detector. Simulation of the algorithm on test image patterns showed an increase in performance relative to the length of the sequence of stereo pairs. On average, the signal to noise ratio ({SNR)} for sparse edge reconstruction was significantly higher than that for single correlation with more detailed edge detectors. Additionally it was found that the processing speed of the sparse edge detection algorithm on a pair of stereoscopic images is faster than the processing carried out by a more detailed edge detector. A test flight was also carried out to test the algorithm in a more realistic scenario. The test confirmed that the sparse edge reconstruction algorithm resulted in a much more detailed view of the environment than if a single, more detailed edge detector had been used.},

Conventional solutions - adding stabilising noise, using an iterated {EKF} or unscented filter, etc., - do not improve the situation. However, if "small" heading uncertainty is maintained, {EKF-SLAM} exhibits consistent behaviour over an extended time-period. Although the uncertainty estimate slowly becomes optimistic, inconsistency can be mitigated indefinitely by applying tactics such as batch updates or stabilising noise. The manageable degradation of small heading variance {SLAM} indicates the efficacy of submap methods for large-scale maps},

	abstract = {This paper presents a new real-time hierarchical (topological/metric) simultaneous localization and mapping ({SLAM)} system. It can be applied to the robust localization of a vehicle in large-scale outdoor urban environments, improving the current vehicle navigation systems, most of which are only based on Global Positioning System ({GPS).} Then, it can be used on autonomous vehicle guidance with recurrent trajectories (bus journeys, theme park internal journeys, etc.). It is exclusively based on the information provided by both a low-cost, wide-angle stereo camera and a low-cost {GPS.} Our approach divides the whole map into local submaps identified by the so-called fingerprints (vehicle poses). In this submap level (low-level {SLAM)}, a metric approach is carried out. There, a 3-D sequential mapping of visual natural landmarks and the vehicle location/orientation are obtained using a top-down Bayesian method to model the dynamic behavior. {GPS} measurements are integrated within this low-level improving vehicle positioning. A higher topological level (high-level {SLAM)} based on fingerprints and the multilevel relaxation ({MLR)} algorithm has been added to reduce the global error within the map, keeping real-time constraints. This level provides nearly consistent estimation, keeping a small degradation with {GPS} unavailability. Some experimental results for large-scale outdoor urban environments are presented, showing an almost constant processing time.},

We propose a high-speed extended-Kalman-filter-based approach that recovers camera position and orientation from stereo image sequences without prior knowledge, as well as the procedure for the reconstruction of 3-D structures. Empowered by the use of a trifocal tensor, the computation step of 3-D models can be eliminated. The algorithm is thus flexible and can be applied to a wide range of domains. The twist motion model is also adopted to parameterize the 3-D motion. It is minimal since it only has six parameters as opposed to seven parameters in quaternion and 12 parameters in matrix representation. The motion representation is robust because it does not suffer from singularities as Euler angles. Due to the fact that the number of parameters to be estimated is reduced, our algorithm is more efficient, stable, and accurate than traditional approaches. The proposed method has been applied to recover the motion from stereo image sequences taken by a robot and a handheld stereo rig. The results are accurate compared to the ground truths. It is shown in the experiment that our algorithm is not susceptible to outlying point features with the application of a validation gate.},

	title = {Efficient Solutions to Autonomous Mapping and Navigation Problems},
	abstract = {This thesis deals with the Simultaneous Localisation and Mapping algorithm as it pertains to the deployment of mobile systems in unknown environments. Simultaneous Localisation and Mapping ({SLAM)} as defined in this thesis is the process of concurrently building up a map of the environment and using this map to obtain improved estimates of the location of the vehicle. In essence, the vehicle relies on its ability to extract useful navigation information from the data returned by its sensors. The vehicle typically starts at an unknown location with no a priori knowledge of landmark locations. From relative observations of landmarks, it simultaneously computes an estimate of vehicle location and an estimate of landmark locations. While continuing in motion, the vehicle builds a complete map of landmarks and uses these to provide continuous estimates of the vehicle location. The potential for this type of navigation system for autonomous systems operating in unknown environments is enormous. One significant obstacle on the road to the implementation and deployment of large scale {SLAM} algorithms is the computational effort required to maintain the correlation information between features in the map and between the features and the vehicle. Performing the update of the covariance matrix is of O(n3) for a straightforward implementation of the Kalman Filter. In the case of the {SLAM} algorithm, this complexity can be reduced to O(n2) given the sparse nature of typical observations. Even so, this implies that the computational effort will grow with the square of the number of features maintained in the map. For maps containing more than a few tens of features, this computational burden will quickly make the update intractable - especially if the observation rates are high. An effective map-management technique is therefore required in order to help manage this complexity. The major contributions of this thesis arise from the formulation of a new approach to the mapping of terrain features that provides improved computational efficiency in the {SLAM} algorithm. Rather than incorporating every observation directly into the global map of the environment, the Constrained Local Submap Filter ({CLSF)} relies on creating an independent, local submap of the features in the immediate vicinity of the vehicle. This local submap is then periodically fused into the global map of the environment. This representation is shown to reduce the computational complexity of maintaining the global map estimates as well as improving the data association process by allowing the association decisions to be deferred until an improved local picture of the environment is available. This approach also lends itself well to three natural extensions to the representation that are also outlined in the thesis. These include the prospect of deploying multi-vehicle {SLAM}, the Constrained Relative Submap Filter and a novel feature initialisation technique. Results of this work are presented both in simulation and using real data collected during deployment of a submersible vehicle equipped with scanning sonar.},

This problem is difficult because of the following paradox: to move precisely, a mobile robot must have an accurate environment map; however, to build an accurate map, the mobile robot's sensing locations must be known precisely. In this way, simultaneous map building and localization can be seen to present a question of `which came first, the chicken or the egg?' (The map or the motion?) When using ultrasonic sensing, to overcome this issue the authors equip the vehicle with multiple servo-mounted sonar sensors, to provide a means in which a subset of environment features can be precisely learned from the robot's initial location and subsequently tracked to provide precise positioning},

	abstract = {Recently, classical pairwise Structure From Motion ({SfM)} techniques have been combined with non-linear global optimization (Bundle Adjustment, {BA)} over a sliding window to recursively provide camera pose and feature location estimation from long image sequences. Normally called Visual Odometry, these algorithms are nowadays able to estimate with impressive accuracy trajectories of hundreds of meters; either from an image sequence (usually stereo) as the only input, or combining visual and propioceptive information from inertial sensors or wheel odometry. This paper has a double objective. First, we aim to illustrate for the first time how similar accuracy and trajectory length can be achieved by filtering-based visual {SLAM} methods. Specifically, a camera-centered Extended Kalman Filter is used here to process a monocular sequence as the only input, with {6DOF} motion estimated. Features are kept live in the filter while visible as the camera explores forward, and are deleted from the state once they go out of view. This permits an increase in the number of tracked features per frame from tens to around a hundred. While improving the accuracy of the estimation, it makes computationally infeasible the exhaustive Branch and Bound search performed by standard {JCBB} for match outlier rejection. As a second contribution that overcomes this problem, we present here a {RANSAC-like} algorithm that exploits the probabilistic prediction of the filter. This use of prior information makes it possible to reduce the size of the minimal data subset to instantiate a hypothesis to the minimum possible of 1 point, greatly increasing the efficiency of the outlier rejection stage. Experimental results from real image sequences covering trajectories of hundreds of meters are presented and compared against {RTK} {GPS} ground truth. Estimation errors are about 1\% of the trajectory for trajectories up to 650 metres.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a visual odometer system using stereo cameras for pedestrian navigation. A novel method for pedestrian navigation based on the knowledge of gait analysis and robust ego-motion estimation is proposed. Two major problems of implementing the system on a pedestrian are stated. Firstly, the features collected from cameras attached on a walking pedestrian normally have winding trajectory resulting in inaccurate tracking. Secondly, the observed object moving independently leads to incorrect ego-motion estimation. Using gait analysis, capturing images at the same stage of the walking cycle produces a less winding trajectory that allows tracking without stabilizing the images. Robust ego motion is also introduced to eliminate outliers that are independently moving features, mismatched features in the stereo matching step and incorrectly assigned features in the tracking step. Data processing techniques including corner detection, stereo matching, triangulation, tracking, and ego-motion estimation are employed. The outcome is the estimated incremental ego motion of the stereo cameras. The approach not only enables the system to operate on walking users but also improves the accuracy of ego-motion estimation.},

	abstract = {Monocular {SLAM} has the potential to turn inexpensive cameras into powerful pose sensors for applications such as robotics and augmented reality. We present a relocalization module for such systems which solves some of the problems encountered by previous monocular {SLAM} systems-tracking failure, map merging, and loop closure detection. This module extends recent advances in keypoint recognition to determine the camera pose relative to the landmarks within a single frame time of 33 ms. We first show how this module can be used to improve the robustness of these systems. Blur, sudden motion, and occlusion can all cause tracking to fail, leading to a corrupted map. Using the relocalization module, the system can automatically detect and recover from tracking failure while preserving map integrity. Extensive tests show that the system can then reliably generate maps for long sequences even in the presence of frequent tracking failure. We then show that the relocalization module can be used to recognize overlap in maps, i.e., when the camera has returned to a previously mapped area. Having established an overlap, we determine the relative pose of the maps using trajectory alignment so that independent maps can be merged and loop closure events can be recognized. The system combining all of these abilities is able to map larger environments and for significantly longer periods than previous systems.},

The method is discussed in the context of ultrasonic radar systems, in which the transmitter and receiver, which consist of ultrasonic sensors, are near each other, and the received signal consists of the transmitted signal reflected by an obstacle. A reference sinusoidal signal is superimposed to a chaotic signal generated by a master chaotic system, and the whole signal is modulated according to the {PPM} method and transmitted by the sensor. The received signal is demodulated, and the demodulated signal forces a slave chaotic system to generate the chaotic signal embedded in it, which allows recovery of the sinusoidal signal by subtracting this chaotic signal from the demodulated echo. The difference of the phases of the reference sinusoidal signal and the recovered sinusoidal signal allows computation of the time of flight of the signal and, consequently, the distance of the radar system from the obstacle. The novel method is illustrated and tested by both simulation and experiments. The interference problem between the considered radar system and other radar systems ( crosstalk) is also addressed, and a solution is proposed to avoid it.},

In this work, a multi-sensory barrier - consisting of infrared ({IR)} and ultrasonic ({US)} sensors- and a vision system, is proposed in order to inform the monitoring system of the existence of obstacles. Due to the fact that any sensor has detection problems which are strongly dependent on meteorological conditions, the use of different sensors for the same task is justified so that the drawback of one sensor is compensated for by the others. The high degree of reliability needed in these environments, where the safety is fundamental, recommends the use of a multi-sensory system. Principal components analysis is applied to the data obtain from the barrier and from the vision system. The use of this technique with the barrier permits concluding if there are obstacles on the tracks; and with the vision system information about moving objects is obtained.},

	abstract = {This paper presents the development of a low-cost indoor ranging technique based on time-of-arrival ({TOA)} estimation, using short-pulse ultra-wideband ({UWB)} signals. The realized system includes two identical {UWB} transceiver devices, in which the receiver section is based on a tunnel diode detector and the pulse generation is performed by a common bipolar transistor driven in avalanche mode. An indirect measurement of the distance between the devices is obtained by measuring the frequency of the generated pulse train. A theoretical model of the system is described and a statistical analysis is presented, including the evaluation of the Cramer-Rao lower bound ({CRLB)} on the distance estimation. Furthermore the principle of operation of the realized system prototypes is described, along with some implementation issues. Finally experimental results are shown and discussed.},

	doi = {10.1109/IMTC.2005.1604520},
	abstract = {Creating 3-D surface representation of large objects or wide working areas is a tedious and error-prone process using the currently available sensor technologies. The primary problem comes from the fact that laser range sensors allow to capture at most one line of points from a given position and orientation, and stereo vision systems accuracy is dependent upon the initial camera calibration, the extraction of features, and the matching of features. When the registration process is not properly controlled, registration errors tend to significantly degrade the accuracy of measurements, which is revealed to be critical in telerobotic operations where occupancy models are built directly from these range measurements. The reliability of range measurements within a singular range sensor technique can drastically distort the registration process, especially within environments unsuitable for the system. Instead of utilizing a single range sensor, we adopt the use of a multi-modal system allowing diverse modes of range sensing techniques to complement each other in the hope that one system's strength could be used to compensate for another system's weakness. Using a mixture of active and passive range sensing techniques, both giving dense and sparse datasets, this multi-modal range sensing system is integrated seamlessly with minimal processing overhead and optimal workspace},

	abstract = {This paper describes a general method for estimating the nominal relationship and expected error (covariance) between coordinate frames representing the relative locations of ob jects. The frames may be known only indirectly through a series of spatial relationships, each with its associated error, arising from diverse causes, including positioning errors, measurement errors, or tolerances in part dimensions. This estimation method can be used to answer such questions as whether a camera attached to a robot is likely to have a particular reference object in its field of view. The calculated estimates agree well with those from an independent Monte Carlo simulation. The method makes it possible to decide in advance whether an uncertain relationship is known accu rately enough for some task and, if not, how much of an improvement in locational knowledge a proposed sensor will provide. The method presented can be generalized to six degrees offreedom and provides a practical means of esti mating the relationships ( position and orientation) among objects, as well as estimating the uncertainty associated with the relationships.},

	abstract = {Abstract: This paper analyzes the consistency of the classical extended Kalman filter ({EKF)} solution to the simultaneous localization and map building ({SLAM)} problem. Our results show that in large environments the map quickly becomes inconsistent due to linearization errors. We propose a new {EKF-based} {SLAM} algorithm, robocentric mapping, that greatly reduces linearization errors, improving map consistency. We also present results showing that large-scale mapping methods based on building local maps with a local uncertainty representation (Tardós et al., 2002) have better consistency than methods that work with global uncertainties.},
