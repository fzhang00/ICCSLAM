	abstract = {Airborne time domain electromagnetic ({TDEM)} surveys are increasingly carried out in anthropized areas as part of environmental studies. In such areas, noise arises mainly from either natural sources, such as spherics, or cultural sources, such as couplings with man-made installations. This results in various distortions on the measured decays, which make the {EM} noise spectrum complex and may lead to erroneous inversion and subsequent misinterpretations. Thresholding and stacking standard techniques, commonly used to filter {TDEM} data, are less efficient in such environment, requiring a time-consuming and subjective manual editing. The aim of this study was therefore to propose an alternative fast and efficient user-assisted filtering approach. This was achieved using the singular value decomposition ({SVD).} The {SVD} method uses the principal component analysis to extract into components the dominant shapes from a series of raw input curves. {EM} decays can then be reconstructed with particular components only. To do so, we had to adapt and implement the {SVD}, firstly, to separate clearly and so identify easily the components containing the geological signal, and then to denoise properly {TDEM} data. The reconstructed decays were used to detect noisy gates on their corresponding measured decays. This denoising step allowed rejecting efficiently mainly spikes and oscillations. Then, we focused on couplings with man-made installations, which may result in artifacts on the inverted models. An analysis of the map of weights of the selected “noisy components” highlighted high correlations with man-made installations localized by the flight video. We had therefore a tool to cull most likely decays biased by capacitive coupling noises. Finally, rejection of decays affected by galvanic coupling noises was also possible locating them through the analysis of specific {SVD} components. This {SVD} procedure was applied on airborne {TDEM} data surveyed by {SkyTEM} Aps. over an anthropized area, on behalf of the French geological survey ({BRGM)}, near Courtenay in Région Centre, France. The established denoising procedure provides accurate denoising tools and makes, at least, the manual cleaning less time consuming and less subjective.},

	abstract = {In this work, we study the inconsistency of {EKF-} based {SLAM} from the perspective of observability. We analytically prove that when the Jacobians of the state and measurement models are evaluated at the latest state estimates during every time step, the linearized error-state system model of the {EKF-} based {SLAM} has observable subspace of dimension higher than that of the actual, nonlinear, {SLAM} system. As a result, the covariance estimates of the {EKF} undergo reduction in directions of the state space where no information is available, which is a primary cause of inconsistency. To address this issue, a new "first estimates Jacobian" ({FEJ)} {EKF} is proposed, which is shown to perform better in terms of consistency. In the {FEJ-} {EKF}, the filter Jacobians are calculated using the first-ever available estimates for each state variable, which insures that the observable subspace of the error-state system model is of the same dimension as that of the underlying nonlinear {SLAM} system. The theoretical analysis is validated through extensive simulations.},

	abstract = {This thesis examines the problem of localising an Autonomous Guided Vehicle ({AGV)} travelling in an unknown environment. In this problem, the {AGV} faces the dual task of modeling the environment and simultaneously localising its position within it. The Simultaneous Localisation and Map Building ({SLAM)} problem is currently one of the most important goals of {AGV} research. Solving this problem would allow {anAGV} to be deployed easily, with very little initial preparation. The {AGV} would also be exible and able to cope with modi cations in the environment. A solution to the {SLAM} problem would enable an {AGV} to would be truly {\textbackslash}autonomous." The thesis examines the {SLAM} problem from an estimation theoretic point ofview. The estimation approach provides a rigorous framework for the analysis and has also proven to be successful in actual applications. The most signi cant contribution of this thesis is to provide, for the rst time, a detailed development of the theory of the {SLAM} problem. It is shown that correlations arise between errors in the vehicle and the map estimates, and these correlations are identi ed as fundamentally important to the solution of the {SLAM} problem. It is demonstrated that ignoring these correlations results in the loss of the fundamental structure of the {SLAM} problem and leads to inconsistency in map},

This estimation method can be used to answer such questions as whether a camera attached to a robot is likely to have a particular reference object in its field of view. The calculated estimates agree well with those from an independent Monte Carlo simulation. The method makes it possible to decide in advance whether an uncertain relationship is known accu rately enough for some task and, if not, how much of an improvement in locational knowledge a proposed sensor will provide. The method presented can be generalized to six degrees offreedom and provides a practical means of esti mating the relationships ( position and orientation) among objects, as well as estimating the uncertainty associated with the relationships.},
