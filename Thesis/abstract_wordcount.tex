This thesis describes the research of an obstacle detection system for a low flying au-
tonomous unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). The system utilized an extended Kalman
filter based simultaneous localization and mapping algorithm which fuses navigation
measurements with monocular image sequence to estimate the poses of the UAV and
positions of landmarks.
To test the algorithm with real aerial data, a test flight was conducted to col-
lect data by using a sensors loaded simulated unmanned aerial system(SUAS) towed
by a helicopter. The results from flight data showed that the algorithm was capa-
ble of mapping landmarks ranging more than 1000 meters. Accuracy analysis also
showed that SUAS localization and landmark mapping results generally agreed with
the ground truth.
To better understand the strength and weakness of the system, and to improve
future designs, the algorithm was further analyzed through a
series of simulations which simulates oscillatory motion of the UAV, error embedded
in camera calibration result, and quantization error from image digitization.
