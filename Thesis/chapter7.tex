\chapter{Conclusion}\label{ch:conclusion}

This thesis described the research that address obstacle
detection problem for low flying SUAS using monocular camera. The
research focused on static obstacle detection for medium size SUAS
deployed in natural environment and performing low altitude terrain
following flight.  An EKF based SLAM algorithm was
proposed in chapter \ref{ch:algorithm}. The algorithm utilized
multiple sensors and inverse depth parametrization to detect distanced
object that range up to a couple thousands meters away. A flight test
was performed to collect aerial video and sensor reading for testing
the performance of the algorithm. In addition, to evaluate the
accuracy of the algorithm, digital terrain map of the survey zone was
processed to compare to the result from the algorithm. 

The flight data was processed, and result was discussed in chapter
\ref{ch:FlightResult}. The proposed SLAM algorithm generates an
estimated terrain map and the trajectory of the SUAS. The estimated
terrain map was compared to the downloaded DEM, and the SUAS
trajectory was compared to the on-board GPS recording.
