% first sentence describes what this algorithm is for, and what it is
% made of.
This thesis described an obstacle detection system for low flying
autonomous unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) using a simultaneous
localization and mapping (SLAM) algorithm, named CC-EKF-SLAM.
% describe the algorithm and it's output 
The SLAM framework utilized an extended Kalman filter to fuse inertial
measurements and monocular image sequence together to estimate the
poses of the UAV and positions of landmarks. A high resolution sparse
terrain map and UAV trajectory can be computed from the filter state
vector. 
%The algorithm was specially designed to detect long distance
%obstacle ranging from several hundreds to one thousand meters by
%adopting inverse depth parameterization and camera centric coordinate
%system.

%flight and result 
The biggest contribution of this work is that the algorithm was tested
and was proven feasible with real aerial video and navigation
measurements. A test flight was conducted to collect data by using a
simulated unmanned aerial system (SUAS) towed by a helicopter. Video
cameras and a number of sensors were mounted on the SUAS. Video and
data were sent to and acquired by a data acquisition system installed
in helicopter. The result from flight data showed that when good
quality features can be extracted from the image sequence, the
algorithm was capable of mapping landmarks ranging as far as 1600
meters. Accuracy analysis on the flight result also showed that
landmarks added to the framework after first frame carried offset
errors.

% The error analysis
To better understand strength and weakness of the CC-EKF-SLAM, and to
improve future design, the algorithm was further analyzed through a
series of simulation. The simulated scenarios were designed to
reconstruct what was seen in the real flight and included: simple
forward motion, oscillatory motion on all other 5 degrees of freedom,
the effect of camera calibration error, and the effect of image
digitization. The simulation showed that the algorithm is very
sensitive to oscillatory rotation, which caused significant error in
both landmark mapping estimates and UAV localization estimates. Other
improvements suggested by the simulation include adding lens
distortion model into the algorithm, and using camera with resolution
higher than 1440x1080.
