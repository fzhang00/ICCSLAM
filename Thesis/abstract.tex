% first sentence describes what this algorithm is for, and what it is made of.
This thesis describes an obstacle detection system for low flying
autonomous unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) using a simultaneous localization and
mapping (SLAM) algorithm.
% describe the algorithm and it's output
The SLAM framework utilizes an extended Kalman filter to fuse inertial
measurements and monocular image sequence together to estimate the
poses of the UAV and positions of landmarks. A high resolution sparse terrain elevation map
and UAS trajectory can be computed from the filter state vector.
An inverse depth parameterization is used to describe the positions of
the landmarks so that features at all ranges can be tracked by the
filter. Camera centric coordinate system was adopted to improve the
consistency of the framework for large area mapping. A test flight is
conducted to test the algorithm in a realistic scenario, and two video
sequences of 400 frames were processed with the described algorithm.
The result shows that when quality features can be extracted from the
image sequence, the algorithm is capable of mapping features ranging
as far as 1600 meters. The accuracy of the feature position estimates
are quite good for those initialized at first frames. Features added
at higher frame number carry offset error due to the error in aircraft
localization estimates. To better understand the contributing factors
of error seen in the flight data result, an series of simulations were
performed to analyze the algorithm under different circumstanstance,
including simple forward motion, oscillatory motion for all
other 5 degree of freedom, error embedded in calibration result of the
camera intrinsic parameters, and image resolution. The simulation
proved that the algorithm perform very well under simple forward
motion, but is very sensitive to rotational motion. Error in camera
intrisic paramters all contribute to localization error and feature
mappping error. Although not all of these error can be prevented, the
len distortion correction procedure should be included into the
algorithm.  The minimum image resultion suggested by the
simulation is 720x1080, beyond which localization and mapping error
were significantly reduced.
