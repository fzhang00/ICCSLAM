I would like to thank my supervisor Professor Rafik A. Goubran and
Professor Paul V. Straznicky for the tremendous level of guidance and
support. Without them, this research would not have been possible. I
would also like to thank Sander Geophysics Limited for carrying out
the test flight and providing the raw data which is invaluable to this
research. Additionally, I would like to thank the Ontario Centers of
Excellence and NSERC (Collaborative Research and Development Grant and
Discovery Grant) for their financial support. 

At last but not the least, I would like to thank my husband Hao Liu,
my parents, and my mother in law for their support over the year of my
studies.
