I would like to thank my supervisor Professor Rafik A. Goubran and
Professor Paul V. Straznicky for the tremendous level of guidance and
support. Without them, this research would not have been possible. I
would also like to thank Sander Geophysics Limited for carrying out
the test flight and providing the raw data which is invaluable to this
research.
